Description: This package facilitates the analysis of agricultural productivity. It queries the FAO 
     GISManager API at <https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1> for different raster datasets 
     concerned with water use efficency in the agricultural sector for which users
     need to order a valid API key. Several indicators to measure the spatio-temporal 
     dynamic of water use efficency can be derived to answer dedicated questions for 
     project evaluations. The package is part of the MAPME toolset at <https://github.com/mapme-initiative> 
     and was developed by MapTailor Geospatial Consulting <https://maptailor.net/>.
     It is in no way associated with FAO or the WaPOR project.
